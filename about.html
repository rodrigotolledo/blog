  Hi!
</p>

<p>
  My name is Rodrigo Bonilha Tolledo, I'm 28 years old and I'm currently working at <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com.au">Campaign Monitor</a> as Automation Test Engineer in Sydney, Australia.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve been working in the IT area in the past 9 years. During these years, I’ve played different roles in multiple areas such as Research & Development, IT Support/Infrastructure, Testing and now I’m currently focused in Software Quality Assurance/Testing and Development.
</p>

<p>
I’m passionate about Agile Software Development/Testing and I like being involved in the entire Software Development Life Cycle. I also enjoy working close to Developers, helping them to develop and maintain different levels of automated tests, such as: unit, integration, UI, API and Performance as well. Exploratory testing is also part of my day. I also believe that Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are mandatory practices for achieving best results.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my girlfriend and friends, ride my skateboard, try different kind of foods (and beers!) and also travel around the world. I'm originally from Brazil but in the past years I've been to Australia (where I'm currently living), New Zealand, USA, Argentina and Uruguay.
