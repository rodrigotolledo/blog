<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>My name is Rodrigo Bonilha Tolledo and I&#39;ve just started this blog in order to start anything related to Software Development, mainly regarding Software Testing which is the area I&#39;m currently working.</p>

<p>I&#39;m graduated in Information Systems and I&#39;ve been working in the IT field since 2005. Since then, I&#39;ve played different roles such as Tester/Researcher, IT Analyst, Test Analyst and today I&#39;m currently working as QA Consultant at ThoughtWorks Brazil in Porto Alegre/RS - Brazil.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still organizing this blog and hopefully I will be posting something useful (or not) from time to time :)</p>

<p>I hope you all enjoy!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>-- Rodrigo Tolledo</p>
