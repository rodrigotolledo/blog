A couple of weeks ago I was researching a little more about how to use CSS Selectors effectively. There are a bunch of materials on the internet, but most of them are just a huge list of selectors which end up becoming a little boring after reading for a while.

So, do you want to learn CSS Selector in a cool way? Here is an awesome app/game made with JavaScipt and some amazing CSS:

Basically, it's a simple game where you have to pick up fruits/objects from a table using CSS Selectors. The difficulty increases after each level.

This knowledge can be extremely useful to find elements in a page when using frameworks like Selenium-WebDriver or Watir-WebDriver, for instance.

Have fun!
