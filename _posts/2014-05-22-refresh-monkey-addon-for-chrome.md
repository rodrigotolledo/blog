I'm currently working in a project that has a simple UI that shows the current state of a bunch of process executions. From time to time I have to watch these executions and hit the Refresh button multiple times to see the executions in *"real time"*.

My colleague mentioned about a Chrome add-on called [Refresh Monkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refresh-monkey/ljngnafhejmefmijjoedbclkadhacebd?hl=en). With this add-on you can easily configure how often you want to refresh your screen and avoid repetition.

Let the monkey work for you!
