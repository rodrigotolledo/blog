Hello everyone!

My name is Rodrigo Bonilha Tolledo and I've just started this blog in order to start anything related to Software Development, mainly regarding Software Testing which is the area I'm currently working.

I'm graduated in Information Systems and I've been working in the IT field since 2005. Since then, I've played different roles such as Tester/Researcher, IT Analyst, Test Analyst and today I'm currently working as QA Consultant at ThoughtWorks Brazil in Porto Alegre/RS - Brazil.

I'm still organizing this blog and hopefully I will be posting something useful (or not) from time to time :)

I hope you all enjoy!

Cheers!

-- Rodrigo Tolledo
