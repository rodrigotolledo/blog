By mid December, ThoughtWorks released an interesting ebook about practices and trend in Software Testing. It includes a variety of topics such as: Agile Testing, Defect prevention, Mocking, Test Automation techniques, BDD, Continuous Delivery, Protractor, Performance Testing, etc.

It also includeds my article about "Performance Testing with Gatling", which has been previously published [here](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/gatling-take-your-performance-tests-next-level) by mid 2014.

I highly recommend reading the ebook. Unfortunately, it was only released in pt-BR (Brazilian Portuguese) language. However, you could easily use any translation tool to read it.

You can download the full ebook version [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/praticas-e-tendencias-em-testes-thoughtworks.pdf) 

Enjoy it!
