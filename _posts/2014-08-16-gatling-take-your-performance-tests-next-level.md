A few months ago I've published an article for ThoughtWorks about Performance Tests with [Gatling](http://gatling.io/). Gatling is an [open-source](https://github.com/gatling/gatling) load testing tool written in Scala. One of the main points of this tool is writing performance tests through a DSL, easy to read, maintain and also treat it as production code.

The idea of this article was sharing my recent experience with a client where I had to develop some automated performance tests.
